# Kickoff for the next session

[Back to the backlog index](../BACKLOG.md)

The thirteenth batch is done: Q16 merged as pull request 59. The backlog is empty. The owner's decisions after Q16
are open on an html-plan page; it recommends a follow-up item, Q17: first rerun the 41 baseline misses that looked
around the empty folder with two turns, then reword the weakest skill descriptions (`codebase-oracle`,
`parallel-worktrees`, `bug-fix`, `lean-subagent-dev`, `sharpen`, `to-prd`) and run the trigger round again with
`--baseline evals/triggers/baseline`.

When the owner answers, record the answers as decision 19 in `docs/backlog/decisions.md`. If Q17 is added, write it
as `docs/backlog/q17.md`, add it to the Contents and "Order" in `docs/BACKLOG.md`, and replace this paragraph with its
kickoff, built from the template below and the Q16 kickoff in this file as of commit 504455f. Read "Things
that bit the thirteenth batch" (`docs/backlog/things-that-bit/batch-13.md`) first.

## The fifth batch's kickoff, as a template

A batch kickoff names the items, the decisions to settle first, and the rules that matter most. For a later batch,
change the item list and the decision paragraph; the rest stays.

```text
You are the orchestrator for the fifth batch of work in this repository: N8 overnight-run, N9
engineering-principles, and the small items P1.6, P1.7 and P1.8. Do not build the skills yourself; run builder
subagents and integrate their work.

Before anything else, read these in full:
1. CLAUDE.md and docs/ADDING-A-SKILL.md (the repository rules, including step 2 and step 8's bump-listing command).
2. docs/BACKLOG.md, especially decision 7 (docs/backlog/decisions.md), "Policy since P0.5" under "Context budget" (docs/backlog/context-budget.md), items N8, N9, P1.6, P1.7 and
   P1.8 (all of each; N8 and N9 in docs/backlog/n-new-skills.md, the P1 items in docs/backlog/p1-small-tooling.md), "How to work an item", "How to run a batch" in docs/backlog/how-to-run-a-batch.md (all 10 steps and every list of things that bit
   earlier batches in docs/backlog/things-that-bit/, the fourth batch's included) and "Order".
3. skills/agent-orchestration/lean-subagent-dev/SKILL.md and its BRIEF-TEMPLATE.md and TRIAGE.md. Work that way for
   the whole session. The usage budget is generous: same model for every subagent, a read-only plan check of every
   brief before any builder starts, a fresh reviewer per item, and a cold run (headless, empty HOME) for any item that
   changes how a skill behaves when it runs.

First, before any brief: the two new skills do not fit the description budget. All descriptions total 11,594 of the
12,000 characters `tests/context-budget.test.mjs` allows, and two new ones at 250 to 350 characters each would pass
it. Ask me to choose: raise MAX_TOTAL (to 13,000, since SLASH_COMMAND_TOOL_CHAR_BUDGET is 80000 on every computer
and in the cloud environment), or trim existing descriptions to make room, and say which you recommend.

The batch, one builder each, each in its own git worktree, with disjoint files:
- N8 overnight-run (new skill, agent-orchestration, with log.mjs and its tests). It runs unattended and launches
  headless runs, so settle in the plan check that it joins CONFIRM_LIST, and keep tests/confirm-step.test.mjs, the
  README and which-skill in step;
- N9 engineering-principles (new skill, planning: an index in SKILL.md and PRINCIPLES.md; read only, so it stays off
  the confirm list unless the plan check finds otherwise);
- P1.6, P1.7 and P1.8 as a small third builder: audit.mjs sees short CLAUDE.md bullets and synced skills (both copies,
  tests first), mutate.sh and Python bytecode, and the evaluator's evidence line.
You own README (skill badge 34 to 36), CHANGELOG, marketplace.json versions, NOTICE, ORIGINS, which-skill,
tests/standalone.test.mjs, the confirm-list test and docs/BACKLOG.md and docs/backlog/.

Rules that matter most:
- Every skill works on its own; no em or en dashes; plain English; Node standard library only.
- Descriptions stay at most 400 characters each and within the total you and I settle, with no angle-bracket tag;
  quote only phrases that ask for the work.
- Builders commit and never push. You push the working branch and open the PR. Never merge it yourself unless I say
  so.
- Watch CI on macOS as well as Linux, and the validate job.

When the PR is open, tell me in plain words what changed, what the reviews and cold runs found, and anything I need
to decide. After I merge it, run `node scripts/pack-skills.mjs --since <main before the batch>` on main and send me
the changed skills' zips together in one bundle zip (a folder of per-skill zips plus HOW-TO-UPLOAD.txt), say which
replace a skill I have and which are new, mark the items done in docs/BACKLOG.md and docs/backlog/, and update the skill count on my
profile README in paureis/paureis. If any hook changed, bump pau-skills-hooks and give me the update commands.
